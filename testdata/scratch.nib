// Simple pattern matching by using multi-clause lambdas

on what fun = fun what

// This works
// length xs = on xs { () -> 0
//                    (cons hd tl) -> 1 + length tl }

// This doesn't
length xs = on xs {

                (cons hd tl) -> 1 + length tl 
            }

// Now both work, hooray
